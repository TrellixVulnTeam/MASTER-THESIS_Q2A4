We present lists of asteroid photometry opportunities for objects reaching a favorable apparition and have 
no or poorly-defined  lightcurve  parameters.  Additional  data on  these  objects  will  help  with  shape  
and  spin  axis modeling  using  lightcurve  inversion.  We  also  include lists  of  objects  that  will  or  
might  be  radar  targets. Lightcurves  for  these  objects  can  help  constrain  pole solutions and/or 
remove rotation period ambiguities that might come from using radar data alone. 


In the first three sets of tables, “Dec” is the declination and “U” is the quality code of the lightcurve. 


Additional data on these objects will help with shape and spin axis modeling using lightcurve inversion.


Objects with U = 3– or 3 are excluded from this list since they will likely appear in the list for shape 
and spin axis modeling. Those asteroids rated U = 1 should be given higher priority over those rated U = 2 or 2+, 
but not necessarily over those with no period. On the other hand, do not overlook asteroids with U= 2/2+ on the 
assumption that the period is sufficiently established. Regardless, do not let the existing period influence your 
analysis since even highly-rated result have been proven wrong at times. Note that the lightcurve  amplitude  in  
the  tables  could  be  more  or  less  than what’s given. Use the listing only as a guide.

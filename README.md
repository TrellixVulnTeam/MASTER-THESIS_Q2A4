## Light curve and photometry analysis of NEAs for orbit determination and rotational period

Asteroids are small bodies of the Solar System that orbit the Sun, and their study is important. They depict the Solar System at its early age. Their study can improve its formation model and contribute to understanding how planetary systems beyond ours formed. Furthermore, the presence of asteroids in the Earth’s neighbourhood, near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), and the possibility of a catastrophic impact with her makes their study crucial. Photometry data provides physical properties such as size and rotation period time. In contrast, the shape and direction of the rotation axis are long-term observations. Also, observations of stellar occultation’s by asteroids are a more direct way of determining their sizes and shapes. 

### General Purpose:
This thesis aims to conduct photometric observations and orbit determination to obtain the physical properties of selected near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from publicly available photometric data and their orbital elements. 

### Specific Aims:
1. Select asteroid targets (NEA's of different groups) from the MPC. 
2. Perform photometric observation with FITS images (For Ivar 1627) and datasets from ALCDEF for the other asteroids. 
3. Build asteroid lightcurves and determine rotation periods using the Tycho software and Python.
4. Obtain ephemeris data from NASA's JPL, especially the state vectors and observation period for orbit determination (using Gibbs and Lambert's problem methods).
5. Analyse the period data and compare results with the ones from the MPC.
6. Perform preliminart orbit determination to obtain the orbital elements and compare the outut with the ones from MPC.

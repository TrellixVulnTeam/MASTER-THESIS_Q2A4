## Light curve and photometry analysis of NEAs for orbit determination and rotational period

Asteroids are small bodies of the Solar System that orbit the Sun, and their study is important. They depict the Solar System at its early age. Their study can improve its formation model and contribute to understanding how planetary systems beyond ours formed. Furthermore, the presence of asteroids in the Earth’s neighbourhood, near-Earth asteroids, and the possibility of a catastrophic impact with her makes their study crucial. Photometry data provides physical properties such as size and rotation period time. In contrast, the shape and direction of the rotation axis are long-term observations. Also, observations of stellar occultation’s by asteroids are a more direct way of determining their sizes and shapes. 

General Purpose:
This thesis aims to conduct photometric observations to obtain the physical properties of selected near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from publicly available photometric data. The properties include the rotation period, the amplitude of the light curve, shape and spin axis orientation.

Specific Aims:
1. Select asteroid targets and plan observations period data. 
2. Perform photometric observation with FITS images. 
3. Build asteroid lightcurves and determine rotation periods and amplitudes of selected asteroids using the Tycho software and python.
4. Extract data set from the Asteroid Lightcurve Photometric Database (ALCDEF) and Minor Planet Observation.
5. Obtain the shape and spin axis orientation through the lightcurve inversion method already implemented in Tycho software and python.

# NEW NEAs

The added NEAs at this moment provide ease of the observation data required. The new NEA's range from three types of asteroids, **Amor, Appolos and Atens**


## STEPS
1. First step is to check the availability of the asteroid in the NEA taxonomy and obtain its data.
2. Download the data in a .txt format instead of FITS (Flexible Image Transport System).
3. then load the asteroid ephemeris data using Find orb, which can then populate the fields in the corresponding columns of the asteroid that miss the data.
4. perform the photometry analysis after loading the ephemeris data
5. Lastly, select the data of consecutive nights based on a specific month of observations and create a light curve both in raw and phase plot. After that, I was finding the period of the asteroid will be possible.

# DATA COMPARISON

The period data obtained for these asteroids is compared by the data found on both the **MPO server** and **ALCDEF**.
